# ReadMoreRemover

#### A simple extension for **Firefox for Android** that automatically clicks the Continue Reading button on:

- [http://www.aol.com](aol.com)
- [http://www.huffingtonpost.com](huffingtonpost.com)
- [http://www.thejournal.ie](thejournal.ie)
- [http://www.inquisitr.com](inquisitr.com)
- [http://qz.com](qz.com)

I created this add on because I do not like having to click a button to reveal more of an article having navigated to it in the first place. If you have any suggestions for other sites that have Read More/Continue Reading buttons create and issue and I'll have a look into adding support for them.

Known to work with **Firefox for Android 56** and above.

It is available to install from the add-ons page inside Firefox For Android or from the add-ons page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/readmoreremover/
