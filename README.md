# ReadMoreRemover

#### A simple extension for **Firefox for Android** that automatically clicks the Continue Reading button on [http://www.huffingtonpost.com](huffingtonpost.com)

I created this add on because I do not like having to click a button to reveal more of an article having navigated to it in the first place. If you have any suggestions for other sites that have Read More/Continue Reading buttons create and issue and I'll have a look into adding support for them.

The extension requires **Firefox for Android 57** and above.

It is available to install from the add-ons page inside Firefox For Android or from the add-ons page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/readmoreremover/
